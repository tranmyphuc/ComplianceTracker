mb-4\"><h1>Module 2: SGH AI Tools &amp; EU AI Act Overview</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/training/eu-ai-act-header.png\" alt=\"EU AI Act Overview Header\"></p>\n<p>The EU AI Act is the world&#39;s first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence, adopted in March 2024. It represents a significant milestone in the global regulation of AI technology, with far-reaching implications for all organizations developing or using AI systems in the European Union.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the EU AI Act Framework</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/training/eu-ai-act-key-features.png\" alt=\"EU AI Act Key Features\"></p>\n<p>The EU AI Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework with several key components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Risk-Based Approach</strong>: Regulatory requirements are proportionate to the level of risk posed by different AI systems</li>\n<li><strong>Prohibited AI Practices</strong>: Explicitly bans certain AI applications deemed to pose unacceptable risks</li>\n<li><strong>High-Risk AI Systems</strong>: Creates stringent requirements for systems with significant potential for harm</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency Obligations</strong>: Mandates disclosure requirements for certain AI interactions</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation Support</strong>: Includes regulatory sandboxes and measures to support innovation</li>\n<li><strong>Governance Framework</strong>: Establishes national authorities and a European AI Board for oversight</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk Classification System: The Pyramid Approach</h2>\n<p>The EU AI Act uses a four-tier risk-based approach to regulate AI systems according to their potential impact:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/training/risk-pyramid-detailed.png\" alt=\"Risk Category Pyramid\"></p>\n<h3>1. Unacceptable Risk: Banned AI Applications</h3>\n<p>AI systems posing unacceptable risks to people&#39;s safety, livelihoods, or rights are prohibited entirely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Social Scoring Systems</strong>: AI that evaluates or classifies individuals based on social behavior or personal characteristics</li>\n<li><strong>Manipulative Systems</strong>: AI designed to exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups or individuals</li>\n<li><strong>Real-time Biometric Identification</strong>: Remote identification in public spaces (with limited exceptions for law enforcement)</li>\n<li><strong>Predictive Policing</strong>: AI that predicts crimes based solely on profiling or personality traits</li>\n<li><strong>Emotion Recognition</strong>: In workplace or educational settings for decision-making</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. High-Risk: Strictly Regulated AI Systems</h3>\n<p>AI systems in critical areas or with significant potential for harm require compliance with extensive requirements:</p>\n<p><strong>Category A: AI Systems in Products Covered by EU Safety Legislation (Annex II)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical devices</li>\n<li>Machinery</li>\n<li>Toys</li>\n<li>Elevators</li>\n<li>Personal protective equipment</li>\n<li>Aviation equipment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Category B: Standalone High-Risk AI Systems (Annex III)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Critical infrastructure management</li>\n<li>Educational and vocational training</li>\n<li>Employment and worker management</li>\n<li>Access to essential services</li>\n<li>Law enforcement applications</li>\n<li>Migration and border control</li>\n<li>Administration of justice</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Limited Risk: Transparency Requirements</h3>\n<p>AI systems that interact with humans, manipulate content, or use emotion recognition must meet transparency requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chatbots and Virtual Assistants</strong>: Must disclose that users are interacting with AI</li>\n<li><strong>Emotion Recognition Systems</strong>: Must inform users when emotions are being analyzed</li>\n<li><strong>AI-Generated Content</strong>: Must be labeled as artificially generated or manipulated</li>\n<li><strong>Deep Fakes</strong>: Must be clearly identified as synthetically generated content</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4.

# Detailed Description of an Admin Dashboard for Web Apps with AI and Google Search API Integration

**Overview:**

The Admin Dashboard serves as the control center for the entire web application, providing a centralized interface to manage all aspects of the app, particularly the integration and management of API keys from various AI platforms (like OpenAI, Google AI, Claude) and Google Search. The admin dashboard is designed with an intuitive interface, high security, and flexible customization capabilities.

**Structure and Main Components:**

## **1. Main Dashboard:**

Displays an overview of the web app's performance and status with critical information:

- Real-time statistics charts showing traffic and API usage
- Number of processed API requests (broken down by AI provider)
- Accumulated API usage costs and forecasts
- Notifications about incidents and issues requiring attention
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) of the system

## **2. API Key Management:**

The central section for managing all API connections with external services:

- **AI API Management:**
  - Interface to add, edit, delete, and manage API keys for AI platforms like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere
  - Display information about key status (valid/expired, active/locked)
  - Configure cost limits and budgets for each API key
  - Track token usage and incurred costs

- **Google Search API Management:**
  - Configure Google Programmable Search Engine (PSE)
  - Monitor the number of search queries used
  - Set daily/monthly query limits
  - Customize search scope and search parameters

- **Rotation Management:**
  - Set up automatic rotation systems between API keys
  - Configure fallback rules when an API key fails

## **3. AI System Configuration:**

- **AI Parameter Adjustments:**
  - Interface to configure default parameters (temperature, top_p, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty, etc.)
  - Store and manage prompt templates
  - Set up default contexts (system prompts)

- **Model Management:**
  - Select and configure AI models in use
  - Establish priority order between models
  - Set conditions for model switching based on performance and cost

## **4. User and Permission Management:**

- Create, edit, delete user accounts
- Assign access permissions to system features
- Set API usage limits for each user/user group
- Monitor user activity and API usage history

## **5. Analytics and Reporting:**

- **API Usage Analytics:**
  - Detailed charts of API usage over time
  - Cost analysis by model, user, and feature
  - Performance reports of different AI models

- **Activity Reports:**
  - Statistics on request volume, error rates, response times
  - Usage trend analysis and cost forecasting
  - Export reports in PDF, CSV, Excel formats

## **6. Security Settings:**

- Two-factor authentication (2FA) configuration
- Session management and timeout settings
- Password policy setup
- Access and activity audit logs
- API key encryption in the database

## **7. System Configuration and Integration:**

- **Webhook Settings:**
  - Configure webhooks for important events
  - Set up notifications via email, Slack, Discord

- **Payment Integration:**
  - Connect with payment systems
  - Manage service packages and paid features
  - Track revenue and expenses

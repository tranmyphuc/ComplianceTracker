To generate the most effective UI/UX for your EU AI Act Compliance Platform through v0.dev, here's a comprehensive prompt you can use. Copy and paste this prompt to v0.dev, adjusting any specific details as needed:

```
Create a modern, professional web application UI for an EU AI Act Compliance Platform. The platform helps organizations manage AI regulatory compliance with an intuitive, data-rich interface. Please design the Executive Dashboard screen with the following specifications:

The Executive Dashboard should include:

1. A clean header with:
   - Company logo on the left
   - Navigation menu with items: Dashboard, AI Inventory, Risk Assessment, Documentation, Training, Tasks, Reports, Settings
   - User profile dropdown in the top-right
   - A global search bar
   - A prominent "AI Assistant" button that opens the chatbot interface

2. A KPI section at the top with four metric cards showing:
   - Total AI Systems (38) with a subtle up arrow indicating growth
   - High-Risk Systems (12) with a warning icon
   - Documentation Completeness (76%) with a circular progress indicator
   - Training Completion (82%) with a circular progress indicator
   Each card should have the metric name, value, change indicator, and a subtle icon

3. A main content area with:
   - A donut chart showing "Systems by Risk Level" with segments for High Risk (red), Limited Risk (amber), and Minimal Risk (green)
   - A horizontal bar chart showing "Compliance by Department" with different departments and their compliance percentage
   - A timeline visualization showing regulatory deadlines (Aug 2025, Feb 2026, Aug 2026) with the organization's progress markers

4. A right sidebar containing:
   - "Critical Alerts" section with 3 alert items showing high-priority issues
   - "Recent Activity" feed showing the latest 5 compliance actions taken
   - "Upcoming Deadlines" section with the next 3 dates

5. A bottom section with:
   - "High-Risk Systems Overview" table showing the top 5 high-risk systems with columns for Name, Department, Risk Score, Documentation Status, and Training Status
   - Action buttons for detailed reports

Use a professional color scheme with blue as the primary color, clean white backgrounds, and clear visual hierarchy. The design should be data-focused but approachable, with subtle shadows and rounded corners for UI elements. Include interactive elements like hover states and dropdown menus where appropriate.

The dashboard should feel comprehensive yet uncluttered, providing executives with key compliance insights at a glance.
```

After you receive the Executive Dashboard design, you can request additional screens by using similar detailed prompts. Here's how to structure your follow-up requests for other key screens:

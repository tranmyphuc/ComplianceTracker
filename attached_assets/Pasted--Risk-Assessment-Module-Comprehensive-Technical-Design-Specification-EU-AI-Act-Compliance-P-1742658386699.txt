## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose of the Risk Assessment Module

The Risk Assessment Module is a critical component of the EU AI Act Compliance Platform, designed to provide organizations with a systematic, evidence-based approach to evaluating AI systems against regulatory requirements. This module enables organizations to determine the appropriate risk classification for each AI system, identify compliance gaps, and plan remediation activities to ensure regulatory compliance.

The primary functions of the Risk Assessment Module include:

- Systematic evaluation of AI systems against prohibited use criteria
- Determination of high-risk classification based on Annex III categories
- Detailed risk parameter assessment for comprehensive evaluation
- Evidence collection and documentation to support assessment decisions
- Gap analysis against applicable regulatory requirements
- Remediation planning and tracking
- Assessment review and approval workflows
- Reassessment scheduling and monitoring

By providing a structured, consistent approach to risk assessment, this module helps organizations avoid prohibited AI applications, properly classify high-risk systems, and implement appropriate compliance measures based on risk level.

### 1.2 Regulatory Context

The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) adopts a risk-based approach to regulation, with different requirements applying based on an AI system's risk classification:

1. **Unacceptable Risk**: Systems that are explicitly prohibited by Article 5, including:
   - Social scoring systems affecting fundamental rights
   - Exploitation of vulnerabilities of specific groups
   - Subliminal manipulation techniques
   - Real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces (with limited exceptions)

2. **High Risk**: Systems falling under Article 6 and Annex III categories, subject to strict requirements including:
   - Risk management system implementation
   - Data governance measures
   - Technical documentation
   - Record-keeping systems
   - Transparency provisions
   - Human oversight mechanisms
   - Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity measures

3. **Limited Risk**: Systems with specific transparency obligations, such as:
   - Notification when interacting with an AI system
   - Disclosure of synthetic content (deepfakes)
   - Emotion recognition system transparency

4. **Minimal Risk**: All other AI systems, subject to voluntary codes of conduct

Proper risk assessment is foundational to compliance with the EU AI Act, as it determines which specific requirements apply to each AI system. Organizations must have a systematic approach to evaluating their AI systems against these risk categories to ensure appropriate compliance measures are implemented.

### 1.3 Business Value

Beyond regulatory compliance, the Risk Assessment Module delivers significant business value through:

**Risk Mitigation**: By systematically identifying high-risk AI applications and potential prohibited uses, organizations can avoid severe penalties (up to â‚¬35 million or 7% of global revenue for prohibited systems) and reputational damage.

**Resource Optimization**: Risk-based classification allows organizations to focus compliance resources on systems that pose the highest risk, avoiding unnecessary overhead for minimal-risk applications.

**Strategic Decision Support**: Risk assessments provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making about AI investments, helping organizations balance innovation with compliance requirements.

**Governance Enhancement**: The structured assessment process strengthens overall AI governance by providing transparency, accountability, and documentation of decision-making.

**Competitive Advantage**: Demonstrating robust risk assessment practices can differentiate organizations in the market, building trust with customers, partners, and regulators.

**Audit Readiness**: Comprehensive, documented risk assessments create audit-ready evidence of compliance efforts, streamlining regulatory inspections and certifications.

The module's AI-assisted features further enhance value by providing guidance on complex regulatory requirements, suggesting appropriate mitigations, and accelerating the assessment process.

### 1.4 Integration with Platform Ecosystem

The Risk Assessment Module is deeply integrated with other components of the EU AI Act Compliance Platform:

- **AI Inventory Module**: Receives system information as input for assessments and returns risk classification results to update the inventory.

- **Documentation Management**: Generates assessment documentation and identifies documentation requirements based on risk classification.

- **Task Management**: Creates remediation tasks based on identified gaps and tracks their completion.

- **Training Module**: Identifies training requirements based on risk level and system characteristics.

- **Compliance Reporting**: Provides risk assessment data for compliance dashboards and reports.

This integrated approach ensures consistency across compliance activities, eliminates duplicate efforts, and provides a seamless user experience throughout the compliance lifecycle.

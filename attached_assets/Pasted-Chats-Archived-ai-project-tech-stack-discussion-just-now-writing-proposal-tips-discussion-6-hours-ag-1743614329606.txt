Based on my review of your codebase, I can provide detailed answers to your questions about your EU AI Act Compliance Platform:

TECH STACK
Programming Languages:

JavaScript/TypeScript: Your project is primarily built with TypeScript, as evident from the extensive .tsx files in the client directory and .ts files in the server directory.
Frameworks:

Frontend: React with a component-based architecture
Backend: Express.js (Node.js web framework)
UI Component Library: Shadcn UI components based on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS
Database System:

PostgreSQL: You're using a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for database operations (evident from drizzle.config.ts and database migrations)
AI-Related Libraries:

OpenAI: For AI integrations (as seen in package.json dependencies)
Firebase/Firebase Admin: For authentication and possibly other cloud services
PROJECT STRUCTURE
Main Components/Modules:

Risk Assessment Module: Tools for evaluating AI system risks
Knowledge Center: Educational resources about EU AI Act
Compliance Dashboard: Overview of compliance status
Training Modules: Educational content for users
System Registration: Tools to register and document AI systems
Document Generation: Compliance documentation tools
Compliance Chatbot: AI assistant for compliance questions
Frontend/Backend Structure:

Separate Codebases: Yes, clear separation with:
/client directory for frontend React code
/server directory for backend Express.js code
/shared directory for types and schemas used by both
Database Structure:

Using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
Tables appear to include:
Training modules
Risk assessments
System registrations
User accounts
Expert reviews
Authentication:

Implemented using Firebase Authentication with possible local authentication options for development (seen in the auth-related components and server middleware)
EU AI ACT FEATURES
Risk Assessment Capabilities:

Extensively implemented with risk assessment wizards, matrices, and visualization tools
Technical Documentation Generation:

Implemented with document generators and templates for compliance documentation
Compliance Monitoring/Reporting:

Implemented with dashboards, compliance tracking, and reporting tools
Data Governance Features:

Appears to be implemented with data quality controls and documentation features
Human Oversight Mechanisms:

Implemented with approval workflows and oversight frameworks
CURRENT STATE
Implemented Functionality:

A comprehensive compliance platform covering most EU AI Act requirements
Multi-language support (at least English and German)
Risk assessment tools
Knowledge center with regulatory content
Dashboards for compliance monitoring
Training modules
Document generation
Main Challenges:

Based on your code, potential challenges may include:
Keeping up with regulatory updates
Ensuring legal validity of assessments
User adoption and training
Project Type:

This appears to be a complete application focused specifically on EU AI Act compliance
DEPLOYMENT
Deployment on Replit:

You're set up to deploy on Replit with:
A Vite-based build process for the frontend
Express.js server configured to serve both the API and static frontend files
Port 5000 configured for both development and production
CI/CD Configuration:

While explicit CI/CD pipelines aren't visible, your package.json includes build scripts that could be used in deployment workflows
Your EU AI Act Compliance Platform is a sophisticated application that covers the major requirements for helping organizations comply with the EU AI Act. The codebase demonstrates a well-structured, modern web application with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.

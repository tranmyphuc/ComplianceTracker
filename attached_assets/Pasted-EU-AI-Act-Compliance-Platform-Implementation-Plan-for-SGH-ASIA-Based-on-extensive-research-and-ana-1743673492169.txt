    • Need to transition to a comprehensive microservices architecture as described in the documentation.
    • Lacking specialized services such as Risk Assessment Engine and Regulatory Update Service.
    • Need to upgrade storage systems and data models according to proposed standards.
2. Risk Assessment Module
Current State:
    • Has basic risk assessment functionality.
Gap:
    • Lacking comprehensive assessment process including: Prohibited Practices Screening, Use Case Analysis, High-Risk Determination, GPAI Evaluation.
    • Need to improve classification according to Annex I and III criteria of the EU AI Act.

Completion Assessment:
Based on the gap analysis between the current platform and the EU AI Act Compliance Platform documentation, I assess that the current version achieves about 45-50% compared to the complete system described in the documentation.
Specifically by area:
Component
Completion Level
Notes
System Architecture
40%
Has basic structure but incomplete microservices architecture
Risk Assessment Module
60%
Has basics but lacks comprehensive assessment process
Technical Documentation
40%
Missing automated documentation generator per Annex IV
Regulatory Updates
30%
Having API issues, needs more diverse information sources
Testing and Validation
35%
Missing comprehensive testing tools
Records and Audit Management
40%
Needs stronger audit system
Report Generation
50%
Has basics but needs more specialized templates
User Management
65%
Has Firebase but needs more detailed permissions
Post-Market Monitoring
20%
Almost not implemented
Human Oversight Mechanisms
30%
Needs significant development
Summary:
    • Basic components have been implemented (~60-70%)
    • Advanced features are missing (~30-40%)
    • Integration and security need significant improvement (~40%)
    • Full compliance with EU AI Act is limited (~45%)
To upgrade to a complete version (100%), significant investment is needed in the missing areas, especially post-market monitoring, comprehensive testing, and automated regulatory update systems.

      # EU AI Act Overview
      
      The EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence. 
      It establishes a risk-based approach to regulating AI systems based on the level of risk they pose.
      
      ## Risk Categories
      
      - **Unacceptable Risk**: AI systems that pose a clear threat to people are prohibited
      - **High Risk**: AI systems subject to strict obligations before they can be put on the market
      - **Limited Risk**: Systems with specific transparency obligations
      - **Minimal/No Risk**: Systems with no specific obligations
      
      ## Key Implementation Dates
      
      - Official Journal Publication: Q2 2024 (expected)
      - Entry into Force: 20 days after publication
      - General Application: 24 months after entry into force
      - Prohibition provisions: 6 months after entry into force
      - General purpose AI rules: 12 months after entry into force

      # Conducting Risk Assessments Under the EU AI Act
      
      Article 9 of the EU AI Act requires providers of high-risk AI systems to establish, implement, 
      document, and maintain a risk management system.
      
      ## Key Components of Risk Assessment
      
      1. **Identification and Analysis**: Identify and analyze known and foreseeable risks
      2. **Risk Estimation**: Estimate and evaluate risks that may emerge when the system is used
      3. **Risk Evaluation**: Evaluate risks in expected use and reasonably foreseeable misuse
      4. **Risk Management Measures**: Adopt suitable measures to eliminate or reduce risks
      
      ## Risk Management Process
      
      The risk management process should be iterative and continuous throughout the lifecycle of the AI system.
      
      ## Documentation Requirements
      
      Risk management documentation must include:
      - Description of the system
      - Known or foreseeable risks
      - Risk data used for assessment
      - Risk mitigation measures
      - Testing results and validation

      # EU AI Act Overview
      
      The EU AI Act is a comprehensive regulatory framework for artificial intelligence systems. 
      It takes a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems based on their potential harm:
      
      ## Risk Categories
      
      1. **Unacceptable Risk**: Systems posing clear threats to safety, livelihoods, or rights are prohibited.
      2. **High-Risk**: Systems with significant potential for harm require strict compliance measures.
      3. **Limited Risk**: Systems with transparency obligations but fewer requirements than high-risk.
      4. **Minimal Risk**: Systems with minimal regulation, comprising the majority of AI applications.
      
      ## Key Requirements for High-Risk Systems
      
      - Risk management system
      - Data governance measures
      - Technical documentation
      - Record keeping
      - Transparency and provision of information to users
      - Human oversight
      - Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity

      # Risk Assessment Methodology
      
      Conducting a thorough risk assessment is crucial for EU AI Act compliance. Follow this methodology:
      
      ## 1. System Classification
      
      Determine if your AI system falls under high-risk categories by checking:
      - Is it used in a critical infrastructure sector?
      - Does it make decisions affecting individuals' rights?
      - Is it used for law enforcement or administration of justice?
      - Does it control essential private or public services?
      
      ## 2. Risk Identification
      
      Identify potential risks across these dimensions:
      - Technical robustness and safety
      - Bias and fairness
      - Privacy and data governance
      - Transparency
      - Human oversight capabilities
      - Societal and environmental impacts
      
      ## 3. Risk Analysis
      
      For each identified risk:
      - Assess likelihood (Low, Medium, High)
      - Evaluate impact severity (Low, Medium, High)
      - Calculate risk level (Likelihood Ã— Impact)
      
      ## 4. Risk Mitigation
      
      Develop specific measures to address each risk:
      - Technical safeguards
      - Procedural controls
      - Documentation requirements
      - Monitoring mechanisms
      
      ## 5. Continuous Monitoring
      
      Establish processes for:
      - Regular risk reassessment
      - Monitoring system performance
      - Incident reporting
      - Compliance validation

      # Human Oversight Implementation Guide
      
      Human oversight is a core requirement for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act.
      
      ## Key Elements of Effective Human Oversight
      
      1. **Oversight Design**
         - Integrated from the beginning of system development
         - Appropriate to the system's context and risk level
         - Enables meaningful intervention
      
      2. **Oversight Measures**
         - Real-time monitoring capabilities
         - Override mechanisms
         - Approval workflows for critical decisions
         - Inspection tools for system behavior
      
      3. **Human-AI Interface**
         - Clear presentation of AI-generated information
         - Explainable outputs
         - Uncertainty indicators
         - Alert systems for potential issues
      
      4. **Oversight Personnel**
         - Clearly defined roles and responsibilities
         - Appropriate training and competence
         - Independence from development team
         - Authority to intervene
      
      5. **Documentation Requirements**
         - Detailed oversight procedures
         - Decision logs
         - Intervention records
         - Regular oversight effectiveness reviews
      
      ## Implementation Strategies
      
      - **In-the-loop**: Humans validate every decision before action
      - **On-the-loop**: Humans supervise operation with real-time intervention capability
      - **Over-the-loop**: Humans design constraints and monitor overall performance
      
      Select the appropriate strategy based on risk level, operation speed, and context.
